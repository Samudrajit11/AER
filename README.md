This directory provides matlab files to simulate the thermal motion 
of many particles interacting via hydrodynamic interactions and 
hard-core repulsion. The motion is considered in two dimensions 
and the Rotne-Prager approximation is used for the hydrodynamic 
interactions. Based on the generated trajectories, the area enclosing 
rate is computed.
